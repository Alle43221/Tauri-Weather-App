 /* TO-DO (1) DONE
    Make a GET request (from Rust) to the Weather API and show the current temperature at these coordinates:
      - latitude 36.71
      - longitude -80.97
    (HINT: https://openweathermap.org/current)

    Make a request to find the coordinates of Târgu Mureș and then show the current temperature there.

  <!-- TO-DO (4) DONE
          Show an icon on the screen that suggests the weather conditions (rainy, sunny etc)

<!-- TO-DO (6) DONE
    Allow the user to search for a specific city and what the weather is like there.
    You can choose to use a separate component for this.

/* TO-DO (3) DONE
    Using Geolocation API (in Typescript) and GET requests in Rust, show the user's current location
    and the current temperature on the screen.
    (HINT: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition)

  <!-- TO-DO (8) DONE
        Make it so that the user's favorite cities are persistent even once the app has been closed
        and reopened again.
        (HINT: write the array of cities to a file)
    -->

   /* TO-DO (5) DONE
    Update the current location of the user and the current weather conditions every minute.
    (HINT: use a separate thread in Rust that notifies the frontend to update the temperature;
           and location display; you will need to use events: https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/events/)
